 Hi, I’m Titilayo Kuloyo — an interdisciplinary analyst blending risk analysis, neuroscience research, and data science to solve real-world problems with precision and insight.

With a foundation in behavioral science and research methodology, I’ve investigated neurological behavior in model organisms and applied statistical rigor to explore the relationship between sleep and cognitive function.

 On the business side, I’ve worked in insurance, translating uncertainty into actionable recommendations and helping stakeholders make informed financial decisions.

Currently focused on:
- Data analytics in finance, tech, and healthcare
- Business intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI)
- Building a strong portfolio using Python, SQL, and Excel

 I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Science and a Nanodegree in Business Analytics while applying my cross-disciplinary background to new challenges.

Let’s connect — I’m open to roles in data strategy, financial analytics, and health tech where research meets real-world impact.

You can reach me at Titikuloyo@gmail.com.
